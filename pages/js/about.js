    `I'm a frontend developer with a passion for making inclusive content in order to make tech a space for everyone.<br>
    My strengths are in Object-Oriented Programming through Javascript, and design through HTML/CSS.<br>
    If you visit my homepage you can play the Tetris game I built from scratch in Javascript!<br>

    I'm a video game fanatic with a few speedrunning records under my belt, including a world record placement.<br>
    If I'm not gaming or in my code editor, you'll probably find me cooking, my other favorite activity.`;
